## National Parks Directory: An Application Programming Interface

# Documentation

#### By Krista Rutz. Last updated on April 3, 2020.

Welcome to the National Park Directory API! Use this API to access information about National Parks in the United States and update park closure information in light of the federal social distancing recommendations, which have affected park openings in many states.

## About the data

Data is available in JSON format.

National park entries contain fields for the park name, the park code written in alphabet characters, the two-digit state code, the region of administration within the National Parks Service, the URL of the homepage for the park's website, and a boolean indicating closure status. The application currently contains information on 18 national parks.

#### Example Park Result

```
    {
        "nationalParkId": 17,
        "name": "Denali National Park",
        "alphaCode": "DENA",
        "stateCode": "AK",
        "region": "Alaska",
        "url": "https://www.nps.gov/dena/index.htm",
        "isOpen": false
    }
```
