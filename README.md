# National Parks Database API (C# ASP .NET Application)

## By _**Krista Rutz**_

#### An API application where the user can get and post information about national parks, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/KristaRutz/Week-13-Building-an-API-C-Sharp). _Last Updated 04.03.2020._

## Description

This application lets the user create database entries about national parks, letting them add names, states, park codes, regions, website urls, and a note about whether or not the park is open. Ability to get and post parks is included, in addition to put and delete functionality.

This project was developed in C# on the .NET Core platform with ASP.NET Core web processing, using MVC pattern libraries and a SQL database. Specifically, the app was built using Entity Framework and MySQL to create the schema, and it's hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/KristaRutz/Week-13-Building-an-API-C-Sharp).

It was created for the Epicodus week 13 friday independent project, on week 6 of C# and .NET course: "Building an API".

## Specs

Create an API for state and national parks. The API will list state and national parks. Here are the features to include:

- Application includes CRUD functionality and successfully returns responses to API calls.
- Application includes at least one of the further exploration objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS.
- Application is well-documented, including specific documentation on further exploration.
- Once you complete the requirements for the code review, consider adding other functionality from Mondayâ€™s Further Exploration. Get creative and add other custom routes, scopes and functionality as well. Here are a few other possibilities to consider:
  - Add a RANDOM endpoint that randomly returns a park.
  - Add a second custom endpoint that accepts parameters. Example: a SEARCH route that allows users to search by specific park names.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

- [x] Application includes CRUD functionality and successfully returns responses to API calls.

- [ ] Application includes at least one of the further exploration objectives: authentication, versioning, pagination, Swagger documentation, or CORS.

- [ ] Application is well-documented, including specific documentation on further exploration.

- [ ] Commit history clearly shows eight hours of work.
